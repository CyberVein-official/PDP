Thoughts on Proof of Data Possession Scheme (PDP)-BountyProgramScheme





Introduction: PDP mechanism is currently the most widely used and most mature data integrity certification mechanism in the field of distributed storage, mainly used to detect the integrity of big data files. CyberVein integrates a strict PDP detection mechanism to quickly determine whether the data on the remote node is complete, and make the data block semi-encrypted but unreadable and non-intrusive. Every step of the entire process will be written into the blockchain, tamper-proof and traceable.




Background: The storage of data is the foundation of the database. The PDP mechanism can optimize storage problems and ensure the integrity and existence of fragmented files. It can efficiently obtain data anytime and anywhere, allowing big data to be safely audited. You need to upload or download files in the future. No longer need to run to the central server, there is no problem of information loss or tampering, file sharing can be realized and storage space can be saved.




Development direction: CyberVein PISR database data will be backed up on the DAG storage chain. At the same time, PDP is a data integrity proof solution running on DAG to verify data integrity and security. The main modules include p2p network protocol and hash algorithm , Storage, account management and consensus algorithms. We will provide you with DAG-related materials and documents in the library, so that you can implement DAG in combination with PDP:
